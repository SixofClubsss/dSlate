Written in Go, Ui made using [Fyne](https://fyne.io/). dSlate is designed to help developers build and test on [Dero](https://dero.io/). It is simple to use so that anyone can easily start building powerful dApps.

Users can connect to Mainnet, Testnet, Simulator or Custom daemon addresses. It allows connecting wallets using authentication. There is a smart contract search function, contract installer, simple Gnomon implementation, and some blank tabs for users to play around on with whatever they'd like.
